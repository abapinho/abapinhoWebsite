Here's a simple way to start debugging a job:

  1. Go to transaction SM37;

  2. Click on the job you want to debug;

  3. type JDBG in the command line (without /) and press ENTER;

  4. and... bang! you're now debugging the job.

Thank you Ricardo Monteiro for the tip.
And thank you Ingolf for the [photo][1].
