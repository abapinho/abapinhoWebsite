Usually SAP systems have a predefined time limit for running a program interactively. If the program takes longer to run than that you'll get a runtime execution error. A dump.

<!--more-->

If you know that your program may risk taking longer than what's allowed you can use the function module TH_REDISPATCH to reset the timeout timer. You just have to make sure your program will execute this function module every once in a while.

An old trick involved using the progress indicator (FM SAPGUI_PROGRESS_INDICATOR) but I've heard it stopped having this side effect.

Thank you Andr√© Silva for the tip.
