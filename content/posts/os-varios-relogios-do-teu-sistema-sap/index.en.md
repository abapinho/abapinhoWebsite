Even though you look at an SAP system as a whole, it is composed by several distinct and interconnected parts. There is a small standard program which checks if each part's clock is correct and synchronised.

It probably won't be of much use for your daily work. Still, it's an interesting curiosity.

The program is called RSDBTIME and the result I got when I ran it is here:
