I read somewhere that Eastern mathematicians tend to solve a different kind of mathematical problem than Western mathematicians do.

<!--more-->

This apparently happens because some oriental languages, such as Chinese, are so different in their construction that they end up conditioning the way those who speak them think.

In the same way, the programming language we use to solve a problem will also condition the way we think about it. It seems obvious to me. But I'm saying this in order to arrive at the same idea I arrived at in [the post in which I suggested you be a polygamist][1]: if you speak several programming languages, just as if you speak several languages, you'll be able to approach problems in more ways and you'll be more successful at solving them.

Greetings from Abapinho.
