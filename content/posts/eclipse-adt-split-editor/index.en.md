Sometimes it's useful to look at two areas of the code at the same time. If the areas are in different classes, just open them both. But what if they're in the same class? For example, if you want to make a method inspired by or related to another.

Eclipse ADT allows you to split the code window in two, either vertically (one above the other) or horizontally (side by side). It's in _Edit > Split editor_ but I use it so often that I've memorized the shortcut: ALT + SHIFT + ‘-’.
