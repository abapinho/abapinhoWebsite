When you're going to modify existing records of a database table it is common to first `SELECT` them to see how they are and only then `UPDATE` them with what they will be.

But ABAP is like a Faberg√© egg. The more you look at it the more details you'll find. And now I found this one.

When you `SELECT` when you already know you're going to `UPDATE`, then at the end of the `SELECT` command you can add `FOR UPDATE` and ABAP will go ahead and lock those records for writing immediately.

Here's an example:

```ABAP
SELECT calories FROM cakes WHERE id = 'cupcake' FOR UPDATE.
```

It does have some [rules and constraints][2]. But still quick nice, hum?

Thank you Jason Pier for the [photo][1].
