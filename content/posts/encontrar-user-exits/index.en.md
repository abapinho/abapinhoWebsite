Every now and then we’ll be looking for user-exits and BADIs, BTEs and the like. SAP doesn’t help. But programs appear here and there, almost always called Z_USEREXIT, which help with this unappreciated search. Recently I learned of another one. I share it here because it is the best I have ever seen:

Thanks to Bruno Esperança for the tip.
And thank you [rverscha][1] for the photo.

Greetings from Abapinho.
