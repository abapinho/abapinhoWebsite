Nuno Morais has developed another very useful tool to help simplify mass translations of most SAP objects.

The toold is not for automatic translation between two languages. Instead, it has the following features:

  * Export an Excel file with texts

  * Import an Excel file with texts

  * Copy texts from one language into one or more languages

  * Create a transport order with the changed texts

  * Find object dependencies which lack translations

  * Provides a nicer browsing interface to help on manual translation

Abapinho will be its official repository.

[Code in GitHub][1].

Soon, an instruction manual. Until then, go on and try it. If you like it or have any suggestion please leave a comment here.

Thank you Nuno for having developed this and for sharing it with the world in Abapinho.

Greetings from Abapinho.
