Sometimes a thing is right under your nose and your still don't see it.

At my current client I daily work with a lot of different systems. When I make a change in a setting of one system, either because I'm lazy or because I forget, I end up not applying it to all the others.

But there is a simple way to copy all the ABAP Workbench settings at once from one system to the other.

<!--more-->

You'll find that the settings dialog box has two small buttons on the bottom right corner, one to export/import all the settings to/from a file.

Try it!
