Here we are again facing a dilemma: hide something because it is dangerous and someone can do bad things using this information or teach it because it would be condescending to presume the readers are not responsible enough to know it. Dictatorships usually go for the first: burning books, censorship, etc. Abapinho like to believe that its readers are responsible people and deserve the right to know.

Thus, here it is. No, it's not a user manual on how to enrich uranium nor a formula for homemade nitroglycerin. But it's something similar: a trick that allows you to change standard objects without the need for a key.

<!--more-->

It goes like this:

  1. In transaction SHDB create a new recording

  2. Enter the transaction for the object you want to edit: SE38, SE24, SE37, SE11, etc.

  3. Check the option "Simulate background mode"

  4. Start recording

  5. Enter the name of the object to be edited

  6. Go into edit mode

That's all it takes. Now you can destroy KNA1, ruin T001_SINGLE_READ or mess with whatever standard program is bothering you.

Now you feel more powerful, don't you? I bet you do. Just remember that, with power comes responsibility. If you wreck the system probably someone will wreck you.

Thank you MJ for the tip.

Greetings from Abapinho.
