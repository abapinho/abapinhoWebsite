Picture yourself as a monkey hanging from a tree branch. You want to jump to another branch but it's so far away that you cannot see it. If you jump you'll probably fall to the ground. That's bad.

Some months ago I said that [code blocks should be small][1]. I don't want to repeat myself but having thought about this metaphor I could't resist sharing it.

Each part of an IF command is called branch. IF branches should be as small as possible so that we, the monkeys, can jump between them without hurting ourselves.

Thank you [cuatrok77][2] for the photo.

Greetings from Abapinho.
