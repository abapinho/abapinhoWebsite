As everyone knows, you can select vertical or horizontal blocks of text almost anywhere in SAPGUI, typing CTRL-Y and then dragging the mouse to make the selection. Everyone also knows that this does not work in ABAP editor. But perhaps what some people don't know is that there is a way of making this kind of selection in ABAP editor: press and hold ALT. Now you can select blocks of text. Good, no?

Thanks to SÃ©rgio Fraga for the tip.

Greetings from Abapinho.
