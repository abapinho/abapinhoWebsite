When a porcelain object breaks in Japan, sometimes instead of throwing it away, they mend it. But they don't mend it just any old way; they mend it with gold. This technique is called Kintsugi.

<!--more-->

A large part of our work consists of repairing ABAP code that is broken in one way or another. Most of the repairs I encounter are sloppy, done roughly, without care, using Patex glue that squirts out of the tube uncontrollably, drips everywhere and leaves things hopelessly dirty. It's unfortunate.

We should all make our ABAP patches with gold. And love. It would be more pleasant to look at them and use them. It would be more enjoyable to be an ABAP programmer.

Thanks to [Tsugi.de][1] for the photo.
