And there you are madly typing with SAP when suddenly you need to go to the transaction field and write /OS37 or whatever. But you are writing with so much passion that the thought of leaving the keyboard for a moment to use your mouse seems catastrophic. Instead, you just press 3 keyboard keys:
CTRL-SHIFT-7.

Thank you Renato Sousa for the tip.
