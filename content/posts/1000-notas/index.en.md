In the last years of the previous century, an SAP project manager stubbornly opposed to upgrading the SAP system. Instead, he decided that all the SAP notes belonging to that upgrade were to be manually implemented. All 1000 of them.

<!--more-->

I never did understand why. But I was called to join a team of 8 or 10 SAP consultants who, in the course of 2 weekends, implemented around one thousand SAP notes by hand.

The procedure? After all notes were printed and stacked in a huge pile of paper, each of us had to pick the top one, implement it by hand and then place it into the _done_ pile. Each consultant implemented around 100 notes.

Anyway, I got paid. We all did. An expensive upgrade. And for what? Surely they had to do a proper upgrade at some point.

Once this was done I never bothered to discuss this with anyone again. Not that it was a secret. I just forgot about it. But sometimes I wonder how many errors were made and how badly damaged that system became. It's inevitable to make mistaskes in such a huge task. How did the system survive this?

Strange things happen in the SAP world.
