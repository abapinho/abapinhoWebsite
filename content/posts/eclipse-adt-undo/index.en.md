They say: Don't go back to where you were once happy. But the truth is that in many cases, if you could go back, you would.

## In SAPGUI

But in SAPGUI you're not so lucky. To begin with, even though the ABAP editor can undo, as soon as you save or activate something, it clears the history. And since you have to save in order to jump from one method to another, there's no turning back every time you do it: undo caput. In short, undo in SAPGUI is useless.

To minimise the problem a little, you can switch to _source code_ mode, which always shows you the whole class at once and so at least you can work on several methods at the same time. But as soon as you record something, you flush the toilet.

But the simplest solution to solve the problem is simple: don't use SAPGUI to code.

## In Eclipse ADT

In Eclipse ADT it's simple: when you need to undo, you undo. Even if you've saved and activated and even if you've switched to another window of another class. Whether it's a minute later or the next day. It works the way it's supposed to.

## Conclusion

So, if you're still using SAPGUI and you could be using Eclipse ADT, you're not the sharpest tool in the shed, are you?
