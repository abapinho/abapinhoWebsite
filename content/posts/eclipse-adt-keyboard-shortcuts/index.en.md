I like keyboard shortcuts. If I could do my job without taking my hands off my keyboard I'd be an even happier programmer.

## In SAPGUI

In SAPGUI, if you don't have a mouse, you won't get anywhere. Okay, there are some shortcuts, I won't deny that. But they are few and limited. And they can't be configured. In other words, take good care of your little mouse because you need it to do almost everything.

## In Eclipse ADT

Eclipse ADT is a different story. It has hundreds of predefined shortcuts. You just have to want to learn them. It also allows you to install the [Vim][1] addon (how would I survive without Vim?), which is an incredible text editor based entirely on keyboard commands. As if that weren't enough, you can reprogram all the shortcuts if they don't work for you.

## Conclusion

So, if you're still using SAPGUI and you could be using Eclipse ADT, you're not the sharpest tool in the shed, are you?
