Unless you want to do data editing, the only dignified way to use ALVs these days is through SALV classes. They are more modern and more elegant, and those who use them can achieve a social status until now only available to owners of a [license plate][1].

But SALV is so versatile, with so many possibilities, that an instruction manual is needed to know how to make it fit our needs. If you search for SALV_DEMO* in SE38, you will certainly find countless examples. But there are so many, with so little time. For this reason, the best thing you can do is just go to the program SALV_TEST_TABLE, which is a kind of Swiss army knife, give SALV a try and learn how to use it.

Thanks to SÃ©rgio Fraga for the tip.

And thanks to Ruud Cuypers for the [photo][2].

Greetings from Abapinho.
