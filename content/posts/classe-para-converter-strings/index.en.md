You know how you sometimes have a STRING-type variable and you need to send it to a function that needs it in SOLIX-type? It often happens to me. Well, I have found this great class that converts strings into a wide range of formats:

CL_BCS_CONVERT

<!--more-->

Look at the methods:

RAW_TO_SOLIX
RAW_TO_STRING
RAW_TO_XSTRING
TXT_TO_SOLIX
TXT_TO_STRING
TXT_TO_XSTRING
STRING_TO_SOLI
STRING_TO_SOLIX
STRING_TO_XSTRING
SOLI_TO_SOLIX
XSTRING_TO_SOLIX
SOLIX_TO_XSTRING

Good, no?
