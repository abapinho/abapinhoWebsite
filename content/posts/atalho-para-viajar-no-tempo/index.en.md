Some months ago I [showed how to transform the debugger into a time machine][1].

Today's tip is simple but useful: there is a keyboard shortcut which makes it even simple to travel in time:

shift + F12

Just place the cursor in the line you want to travel to and then... shift+F12.

Thank you Maxsuel Maia for the tip.
