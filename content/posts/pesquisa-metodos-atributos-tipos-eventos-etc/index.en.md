You remember having written a method some years ago which you need now. You know it had the word MALMEQUER somewhere in its name. But what now? How will you find it?

You could use transaction SE24 to look at every class you worked on since then. But that would probably keep you busy for ages. Don't do that.

Try using transaction SE84 instead:
