The PARAMETERS and SELECT-OPTIONS already have some configuration options. But sometimes you need more control, more customising. Interestingly, although it's not simple nor obvious, it can be done through a standard function module.

<!--more-->

Function module SELECT_OPTIONS_RESTRICT.

Let's see how we can use it.
Here's a selection screen:


{{< highlight ABAP >}}
SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF BLOCK b1 WITH FRAME TITLE text- s01.
PARAMETERS: p_db AS CHECKBOX DEFAULT 'X' USER-COMMAND uc1.
PARAMETERS: p_bu AS CHECKBOX DEFAULT ' ' USER-COMMAND uc2.
SELECTION-SCREEN END OF BLOCK b1.

SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF BLOCK b2 WITH FRAME TITLE text- s04.
SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF LINE .
SELECTION-SCREEN COMMENT 1(22 ) text- c01 MODIF ID db1 .
SELECTION-SCREEN END OF LINE .
SELECT-OPTIONS: s_iwerko FOR mpos- iwerk NO INTERVALS MODIF ID db1.
SELECTION-SCREEN SKIP.
SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF LINE .
SELECTION-SCREEN COMMENT 1(22 ) text- c02 MODIF ID db1 .
SELECTION-SCREEN END OF LINE .
SELECT-OPTIONS: s_iwerkd FOR mpos- iwerk NO INTERVALS MODIF ID db1.
SELECT-OPTIONS: s_gsber FOR mpos- gsber  MODIF ID db2 .
SELECTION-SCREEN END OF BLOCK b2.

SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF BLOCK b3 WITH FRAME TITLE text- s05.
SELECT-OPTIONS: s_mptyp FOR mpla- mptyp MODIF ID db3 ,
                s_warpl FOR mpos -warpl MODIF ID db3,
                s_wapos FOR mpos -wapos MODIF ID db3,
                s_plnty FOR mpos -plnty MODIF ID db1.
SELECT-OPTIONS: s_iwerk FOR mpos- iwerk MODIF ID db2 .
SELECTION-SCREEN END OF BLOCK b3.

SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF BLOCK b4 WITH FRAME TITLE text- s02.
PARAMETERS: p_empty AS CHECKBOX MODIF ID fcb USER-COMMAND uc2 .
PARAMETERS: p_file LIKE rlgrap- filename MODIF ID fil .
SELECTION-SCREEN END OF BLOCK b4.

And here's the code that demonstrates how to use the SELECT_OPTIONS_RESTRICT function module:

{{< highlight ABAP >}}
FORM so_plant_restrictions.
* Include type pool SSCR
  TYPE-POOLS sscr.

* Define the object to be passed to the RESTRICTION parameter
  DATA restrict TYPE sscr_restrict.

* Auxiliary objects for filling RESTRICT
  DATA opt_list TYPE sscr_opt_list.
  DATA ass      TYPE sscr_ass.

* Define the option list

* ONLY EQ Allowed
  CLEAR opt_list.
  MOVE 'JUST_EQ'  TO opt_list-name .
  MOVE 'X'        TO opt_list -options- eq.
  APPEND opt_list TO restrict-opt_list_tab .

* KIND = 'S': applies to SELECT-OPTION S_TIMEST
  CLEAR ass.
  MOVE: 'S'        TO ass- kind,
        'S_IWERKO' TO ass- name,
        'I'        TO ass- sg_main,
*        '*'        to ass-sg_addy,
        'JUST_EQ'  TO ass- op_main,
        'JUST_EQ'  TO ass- op_addy.
  APPEND ass TO restrict-ass_tab .
  MOVE: 'S'        TO ass- kind,
        'S_IWERKD' TO ass- name,
        'I'        TO ass- sg_main,
*        '*'        to ass-sg_addy,
        'JUST_EQ'  TO ass- op_main,
        'JUST_EQ'  TO ass- op_addy.
  APPEND ass TO restrict-ass_tab .

* Call function module
  CALL FUNCTION 'SELECT_OPTIONS_RESTRICT'
    EXPORTING
      restriction                = restrict
    EXCEPTIONS
      too_late                   = 1
      repeated                   = 2
      not_during_submit          = 3
      db_call_after_report_call  = 4
      selopt_without_options     = 5
      selopt_without_signs       = 6
      invalid_sign               = 7
      report_call_after_db_error = 8
      empty_option_list          = 9
      invalid_kind               = 10
      repeated_kind_a            = 11
      OTHERS                     = 12.
ENDFORM.                    "so_plant_restrictions
{{< /highlight >}}

As you can see, this function module gives you a lot of control over the selection screen. You're not going to use it every day. But it's one of those things that you'll need sooner or later so you better know it exists and how to use it.

Thank you Lu√≠s Rocha for the tip.
