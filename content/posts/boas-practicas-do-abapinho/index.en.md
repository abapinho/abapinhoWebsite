Recently, I have compiled a set of personal best practices. I decided to share them here by creating a new category (which will soon appear on the menu to the left) into which they will be grouped. The original idea was to make a PDF file but, since they are constantly being reviewed and expanded, this was largely impractical. As such, they will be published one by one.

The goal is for these practices to be visible in their entirety as a user-friendly, accessible reference. I don’t know about you, but I, for one, will be using them.

Not all of them will be to everyone’s liking. And this is good. I say this selfishly, for I hope anyone who is dissatisfied will make themselves known and their ideas and opinions can help me improve them or rethink them.

Whether to your liking or not, I hope that one or two will at least be inspiring.

Stay tuned. They will soon begin to appear.

Greetings from Abapinho.
