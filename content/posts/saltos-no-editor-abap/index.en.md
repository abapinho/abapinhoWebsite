Have you ever found yourself programming in one of those ABAP programs that’s as long as the Bible with hundreds and hundreds of lines where you always have to jump from one code area to another?

Until a few days ago, in my ignorance I was using PageUp and PageDown to jump between the two locations and I wasted loads of time looking for the exact place in the code that I was interested in.

But in the mean time, Sérgio Fraga taught me that ABAP editor has a function called _bookmarks_ which avoids the nonsense of going up and down blindly.

First just press CTRL-ALT-1 at a specific line to define _bookmark_ 1 there, CTRL-ALT-2 to define _bookmark_ 2, and so on up to 9.

Then you can just hit CTRL-1 to go directly to _bookmark_ 1, CTRL-2 for 2 and so forth.

Then you can jump from place to place like there’s no tomorrow.

While we’re about it, the _bookmarks_ can also be defined through the menu you get when you right-click in the editor’s left margin.

If you exit the editor, you destroy everything as the _bookmarks_ are not saved, but even so, they are still handy as they are so easy to use.

Thank you Sérgio Fraga!
