Do you know about the EGSAP_TECH app? It's a SAP knowledge bank.

Here is a description in the words of its own creators:

<!--more-->

These days there are lots of SAP blogs, websites, YouTube videos, documents, etc. ...
But to stay up-to-date or learn something new, you have to enter and search a whole heap in Google to find a few good things...
The EGSAP_TECH application does all the work for you. You can learn and stay up-to-date with just one touch of your smartphone.

EGSAP_TECH is an application where users can find FREE links to SAP tutorials, documents, videos, etc... all in just one place! What’s more, you can stay up-to-date with SAP RSS feeds in your area of interest.
You can share your links/documents/videos on Facebook or Twitter, and save your documents in Google Drive or Dropbox. You can also select your data source: web, local files or both!
Our goal is to create a “community” where everyone can send their favourite links/documents/videos so that we can grow every day and have the best of the best knowledge available, all FREE OF CHARGE!
