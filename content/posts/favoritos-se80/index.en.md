The SE80 transaction contains everything. It seems like those village grocery stores crammed with junk where you can buy toothpaste, bread, shoes, perfume and rice in bulk. I like these grocery stores. But to go there you need to know where you are going, otherwise you'll walk from pillar to post.

But this is what it's like in these grocery stores but in SE80.... there are favourites.

Yes indeed there are. I only discovered a few days ago that the SE80 transaction is able to store favourites. It is a handy little button right here. See photo:

Each time you visit an object that you think you'll visit again in the future, all you have to do is insert it in your favourites list and then you'll never have to search for it again.

Thank you Nuno Morais for the tip.
