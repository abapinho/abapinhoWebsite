Normally when you log on to SAP the SAP menu appears. But you can use the function module **NAVIGATION_SET_START_TCODE** to pre-set an initial transaction. Anyway, it’s better to know it’s there than not to know it’s there, and even better than knowing that it’s not there.
Who knows – it could be good for some users. There’s also the function module **NAVIGATION_GET_START_TCODE** to see what is pre-set.
