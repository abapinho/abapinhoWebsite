Simple tip to speed up entering data in (some) fields.

<!--more-->

On SE24, when you want to define a method's type or visibility, instead of writing "Protected" try writing "1" followed by ENTER instead.

After:
[![1234_2][2]][2]

This works in many other places ;-)

Life is in the details.

Thank you SÃ©rgio Fraga for the tip.

Thank you Fairy Heart for the [photo][3].
