If you really need to access an SAP and nobody lets you, and you don’t have a computer where you can install it or you don’t have enough know-how or patience to do it, you can always rent.

Here, for example:
<http://www.idesaccess.com>

Did you know about this?

It’ll cost you approximately 60 euros a month. It’s more expensive than Angry Birds, but still reasonable.

Thanks to [wildxplorer][1] for the photo.
