Hi. How've you been? How's life? All cool? This tip is so simple that if we don't talk for a while it will all end too quickly. The sun is shinning. It rained in the morning but now it stopped.

Moving on.

Every time I see someone still using SE16 I wonder why, since SE16N is so much better and already exists for so long. But this is not the tip.

The tip is that in SE16N you can turn a technical view on which, besides the field's technical name, gives you more useful information on the field.

You can find it under the "Extras" menu:

Thank you SÃ©rgio Fraga for the tip.

And thank you OZinOH for the [photo][5].

Greetings from Abapinho.
