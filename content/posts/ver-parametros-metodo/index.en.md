Let's say you want to call a method for which you don't know the parameters. What do you do?

You used to have to use the "pattern" button. Or open the class in a new window to look at the method's parameters. But then the ABAP Editor evolved and we got [auto-complete][1] which made everything much more easy.

But there is yet another way.

<!--more-->

If you right-click on the method you'll get this menu:

Pick the Tooltip option et voil√°:

[![tooltipforinstancemethod][3]][3]

Interesting, no?

Thank you Ricardo Monteiro for the tip.

And thank you Susan von Gelder for the [photo][4].

Greetings from Abapinho.
