I have always used * to comment my code. I only used " for pseudo-comments or to leave small comment at the end of a line.

But I recently learned that using " makes much more sense.

<!--more-->
While * is always anchored at the start of the line, " is properly formatted by _pretty printer_.

So, I spent all these years manually indenting my comments whenever my code changed and comments became misaligned while, had I used ", everything would have been properly indented automatically. Why didn't Abapinho teach me this 10 years ago? Ah... because, since I didn't know it myself... I couldn't have written it. Linear time is a sad prison indeed.

Greetings from Abapinho.
