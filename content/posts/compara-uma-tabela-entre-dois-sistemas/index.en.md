The SCMP transaction compares the content of a table across two systems. It is very useful, especially for parameterization tables.

It is very easy to use. It allows for the pre-selection of the registers and fields to compare. It also allows you to only display the differences, which is convenient for tables with lots of data. I don’t think any more explaining is required. _Ite et videte_.

This tip recently appeared in the ex SAPtricks blog and I think it is so useful that I have reposted it here, in case you haven’t already seen it.

Thanks to Dale Harris for the [photo][1].
