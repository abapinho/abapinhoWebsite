Select a word in the ABAP editor and choose CTRL-C. Then select another word and choose CTRL-C again. Then another word and so on. You have copied words several times to the _clipboard_. Experience and common sense tells us that if you choose CTRL-V you can only paste the last word you copied to the clipboard.
But that is not quite right. You may not be aware of it, but the ABAP editor has a good memory.

<!--more-->

Try out CTRL-SHIFT-V. A list of the last things you copied to _clipboard_ appears!
