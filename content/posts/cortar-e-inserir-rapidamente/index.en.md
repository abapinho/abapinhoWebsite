I learned yet another small obscure SAPGui functionality. How to speed up copy and paste.

<!--more-->

In SAPGui's customization menu turn on the _Quick Cut and Paste_ option. Now, when you select any piece of text, it is immediately copied to the Clipboard. Then you can just go ahead and paste it wherever you want.

I wonder if this is that useful. I don't think I'm going to use it. Besides, the way Cut and Paste works is, for me, something that should be defined at Operating System level and behave similarly across all applications. I don't understand some of these SAP functionalities. But, well, here it is, in case you didn't already know about it. Go ahead and use it if you like it.

Greetings from Abapinho.
