In my current customer, I have three development systems. There used to be only one. And that's where I customized and fine tuned the Code Inspector_ variant I use to run _Abap Test Cockpit_.

When the other two appeared, before manually copying the variant into them, I decided to investigate a little bit. Much to my surprise, I found in GitHun project [upDOWNci][1] which does exactly what I needed: export and import _Code Inspector_
Now, copying the variant was a piece of cake.

Thank you, [Lars][2] for making this small but useful tool. Actually, thank you for the dozens of useful tools you've already given us. They're quite impressive.

Greetings from Abapinho.
