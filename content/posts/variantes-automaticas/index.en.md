When developing a report with a selection screen it is very annoying that every time we test it we have to input the test data to the selection screen. We usually end up creating a variant of the test to save us from this hassle. But, every time we run the report we still have to manually call this variant.

Here is a simple way to automatically call a variant.
This code can be inserted into the INITIALIZATION event during the development of the program:


{{< highlight ABAP >}}
INITIALIZATION.

  CALL FUNCTION 'RS_SUPPORT_SELECTIONS'
    EXPORTING
      report                     = sy-repid
      variant                    = 'TESTE'
 EXCEPTIONS
   VARIANT_NOT_EXISTENT       = 1
   VARIANT_OBSOLETE           = 2
   OTHERS                     = 3.

Thank you SÃ©rgio Fraga for the tip.
