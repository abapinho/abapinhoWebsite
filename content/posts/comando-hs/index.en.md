Most functionals, and even the hardcore functionals, knows that in order to start debugging an ABAP program, we use the /H command. But few programmers, even the hardcode programmers, will know the purpose of the /HS command.

<!--more-->

Itâ€™s used to start the debugger already with the system debug option enabled.

Try it: /HS

Now you ask me: why the hell would I want to debug the system?
And I answer: maybe you will, maybe you won't, but knowledge is power.

Thank you NIAID_Flickr for the [photo][1].
