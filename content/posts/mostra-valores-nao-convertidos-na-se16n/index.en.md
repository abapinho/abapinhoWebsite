By default SE16N always shows the values in the external format, applying the conversion exit to all of them. Until recently, I used to go the ancient SE17 whenever I needed to see them in their internal format. But Rui Nunes told me how to do it in SE16N.

<!--more-->

Just go to menu "Extras | Change Settings" and check the option "Output without Conversion Exit".

As simple as that.

Thank you Rui Nunes
