I don't.

And I don't want to. Why waste memory on stuff like that?

And I don't need to because ABAP has a class just for that.

<!--more-->

Meet **CL_ABAP_CHAR_UTILITIES**. It has some methods to convert ENDIAN to number and vice-versa, but that's not why I'm talking about it. It's because of the constants it defines:

  * HORIZONTAL_TAB

  * VERTICAL_TAB

  * NEWLINE

  * CR_LF

  * FORM_FEED

  * BACKSPACE

  * and some more

When you need a CR_LF, instead of trying to find its ASCI code you can simply type CL_ABAP_CHAR_UTILITIES=>CR_LF and there you have it.

Thank you SÃ©rgio Serra for the tip.

Greetings from Abapinho.
