We are constantly learning. But once in a while we learn something which is a leap forward forcing us to look in a new way to everything we do.

The last time this had happened was when I started using OO in ABAP. OO was not new to me as I had already used it extensively in Java, C#, C++, etc. But to finally be able to apply these precious concepts on my daily job was a relief and a big improvement in the quality, flexibility and speed of my work.

I feel now in the middle of a new leap forward. Because I'm finally learning how to use software design patterns. I've always heard about them but never gave them much though. For example, the ABAP site ZEVOLVING already [talked about them][1] a long time ago and I remember having read many of these articles. But somehow I still hadn't found a text which not only explains them but also makes their advantages clear.

Now, thanks to Miguel Jorge, I have found one:: [Head First Design Patterns][2]. Besides being funny, it explains in a clear and simple way, the limitations of OO paradigms and how patterns can help overcome them.

[This site][3] has links to several interesting texts on this subject. It even has a link to a PDF version of the aforementioned book. And also to [this page][4] which lists them and even criticizes them.

From now on, whenever I'm designing software in OO I'll always try to be aware of the available patterns and try to apply them whenever appropriate.

Thank you Miguel Jorge!

Greetings from Abapinho.
