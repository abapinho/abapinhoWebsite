And that's it really. That's the whole tip right there at the title. This has always been right under your nose but you probably never thought about it: you can save variants in SE16N. And they can even be user-specific. So useful and so little known.

Thank you SÃ©rgio Fraga for the tip.
Thank you Cloudtail for the [photo][1].

Greetings from Abapinho.
