At the bottom right corner of ABAP editor, right in the status line, you can check in which line and column the cursor is. By double clicking over that information a dialog box is shown and you will be able to introduce a line number to it skip directly. The short key is CTRL-O. It's very helpful.

Thank you FÃ¡bio Branquinho for the tip.

And thank you to [juandesant][1] for the photo.

Greetings from Abapinho.
