To indent a block of lines do the following:

<!--more-->

  1. Position the cursor at the start of the first line to indent;

  2. Press SHIFT + ALT;

  3. Press the down arrow until you reach the last line to indent (nothing seems to happen, that's normal);

  4. Press TAB to indent the block.

Comes in handy.

Some years ago Abapinho showed you [how to select text vertically][1] in the ABAP editor. This is pretty much the same thing. Once you have selected a vertical block of text this way you can also press TAB to indent it.

Thank you Miguel Jorge for the tip.
