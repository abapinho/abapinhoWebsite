SAP has a book called [Official ABAP Programming Guidelines][1] which describes rules and best practices on how to program in ABAP. In there you can read:

Page 42: Rule 3.1: Use ABAP Objects whenever possible for new and further developments. Classic processing blocks may be newly created in exceptional cases only.

Page 45: Within such a [classic] processing block, however, you should immediately delegate the execution to a suitable method (see Rule 6.37, No Implementation in Function Modules and Subroutines, and Rule 6.44, No Implementation in Dialog Modules and Event Blocks).

So, if you still use Classic ABAP you're chicken :)

Thanks [dawnhops][2] for the photo.

Greetings from Abapinho.
