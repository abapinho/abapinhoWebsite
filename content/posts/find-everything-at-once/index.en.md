The ABAP editor is full of functionalities yet to be discovered.

When I do CTRL-F to search for text, the option I usually choose is "Find next".

<!--more-->

But there is another very useful option which I only recently learned about: "Select all".

When you choose this option, it bookmarks every line containing the searched text. With the bookmarks in place you can easily navigate through the whole code, easily identifying the relevant lines.

Thank you, Nuno Morais for the tip.
