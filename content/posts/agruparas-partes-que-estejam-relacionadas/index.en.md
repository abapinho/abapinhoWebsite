Sometimes you find an IMPORT in the code but you have no idea where the corresponding EXPORT is. When communication is needed between programs, it should be done using a pair of methods belonging to the same class. This way, when we run into one, weâ€™ll always know where the other one is.
Anyway, try to use EXPORT/IMPORT only when unavoidable. If possible, use static class variables instead.
