The ABAP editor has many curious functionalities.
You can even write in multiple lines at the same time.

<!--more-->

Make a [vertical selection][1]. Now try writing something and you'll be surprised to find out that you'll be writing in all the selected lines at the same time.

It's fun. And it can be useful too.

Thank you Miguel Jorge for the tip.

Greetings from Abapinho.
