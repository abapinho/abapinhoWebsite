Nuno Morais developed a very useful tool which can compare objects between systems and works much better than transaction SREPO.

Abapinho will be its official repository.

[Code in GitHub][1].

Soon, an instruction manual. Until then, go on and try it. If you like it or have any suggestion please leave a comment here.

Thank you Nuno for having developed this and for sharing it with the world in Abapinho.

Thank you AJ Cann for the [photo][2].

Greetings from Abapinho.
