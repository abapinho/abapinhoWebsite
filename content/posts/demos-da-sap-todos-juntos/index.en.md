When I was a little boy, back in the 80's, I had to type `LOAD ""` and then wait for several minutes staring at stripes in a TV and listening to strange noises before a ZX Spectrum game was ready to be played. Many years later, when I already had a PC, I found an emulator which had a menu with hundreds of ZX Spectrum games. I just had to pick one from the list and start playing immediately.

<!--more-->

SAP has package that reminds me of that emulator. It aggregates all the demo code that SAP references in its documentation: `SABAPDEMOS`. Now you know where to look if you want to play with ABAP demo code. And if there's something you don't know how to do you'll most probably find an example in there.

Thank you Daniel Campos for the tip.

Greetings from Abapinho.
