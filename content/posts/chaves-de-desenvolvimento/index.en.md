When I get to a new project the system administrator generates a development key for each development system assigned to our SAP username. Usually it's sent to me by e-mail. Usually I lose track of it.

Now you know that all development keys of an SAP system are stored in a database table called `DEVACCESS`. If you don't know yours for a given system you just need to look it up in this table.

Thank you David Ralo for the tip.
