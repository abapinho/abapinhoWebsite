Official ABAP Programming Guidelines (page 34): [When a classical processing block is required], you should immediately delegate the execution to a suitable method (see Rule 6.37, No Implementations in Function Modules and Subroutines, and Rule 6.44, No Implementations in Dialog Modules and Event Blocks).
