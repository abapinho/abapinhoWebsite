You're in the middle of a debug and want it to stop at a specific message.

What to do?

<!--more-->

Press F9 to create a new break-point, choose the "Message" tab and there you'll be able to specify the exact message id, number which should stop execution. You can even define the type of message (error, warning, etc.). That's it.

While you're there take a look at the other tabs to see what else you can do there.

Thanks Hamid Kharoune for the tip.
