_You Ain't Gonna Need It_ means _Do what you want, but don't say I didn't warn you_. Just kidding. Not really.

<!--more-->

When you're excited about developing something, you tend to do more than you need to because you think one day it will probably be needed.

Extreme Programming (XP) is an Agile software development methodology. One of its rules is called YAGNI. The rule stipulates that if you don't need a feature now, you shouldn't implement it because, even if you think it will be needed, it most likely never will be.

It's a good rule. Adopt it.
