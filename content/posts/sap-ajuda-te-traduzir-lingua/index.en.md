Every once in a while I find yet another hidden SAP virtue. I just found out that there is a transaction which, for a given word in a given language, will help you translate it to another language by showing you which other translations already exist for that same word.

How cool is that? Ok, it's not Google Translate, but it's a nice help.

Oh, I almost forgot. The transaction is called STERM.

Thank you SÃ©rgio Fraga for the tip.

Greetings from Abapinho.
